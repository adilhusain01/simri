## 🚀 Pro Tips for Best Insights

* Track **add-to-cart, checkout started, payment success, and order complete** as separate steps (to find where drop-offs happen).
* Segment customers: **first-time vs. repeat buyers**—they behave differently.
* Set up **alerts**: e.g., if sales drop by 30% in a day or cart abandonment spikes.
* Regularly review **search terms inside your store** (customers might be searching for gifts you don’t offer yet).
