# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Structure

This is a full-stack gift selling e-commerce application with a client/server architecture:

- **client/**: React frontend built with Vite, TanStack Router, and Tailwind CSS  
- **server/**: Complete Node.js/Express backend with TypeScript (✅ **PRODUCTION READY**)

## Common Development Commands

### Backend Development Commands (Server Ready!)

From the `server/` directory:

```bash
cd server
npm install              # Install dependencies
npm run dev             # Start development server on port 8000  
npm run build           # Build TypeScript for production
npm start               # Run production build
npm run seed            # Seed database with sample data
docker-compose up -d    # Start PostgreSQL + Redis + Adminer
docker-compose down -v  # Stop and remove containers + volumes
```

### Frontend Development Commands

All commands should be run from the `client/` directory. See `client/CLIENT_DOCUMENTATION.md` for detailed frontend architecture.

### Client Development
```bash
cd client
npm install              # Install dependencies
npm run dev             # Start development server on port 3000
npm run build           # Build for production (runs vite build && tsc)
npm run serve           # Preview production build
npm run test            # Run tests with Vitest
```

### Code Quality
```bash
npm run lint            # Lint code with Biome
npm run format          # Format code with Biome  
npm run check           # Run both lint and format checks
```

### Adding Components
```bash
pnpx shadcn@latest add button    # Add Shadcn components
```

## Architecture Overview

### Frontend Stack
- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **TanStack Router** for routing (code-based routing setup)
- **TanStack Query** for server state management
- **TanStack Store** for client state management
- **Tailwind CSS v4** with Vite plugin
- **Shadcn/ui** components
- **Vitest** for testing
- **Biome** for linting and formatting

### Key Configuration
- **Vite**: Uses `@vitejs/plugin-react` and `@tailwindcss/vite`
- **TypeScript**: Path alias `@` points to `./src`
- **Biome**: Uses tab indentation, double quotes, ignores `src/routeTree.gen.ts`
- **Testing**: Vitest with jsdom environment and global test APIs

### Routing Architecture
- Currently uses **code-based routing** with routes defined in `src/main.tsx`
- Routes are created using `createRoute()` and assembled into a route tree
- Can be migrated to file-based routing using `@tanstack/router-plugin`
- Root layout includes TanStack Router Devtools

### State Management
- **TanStack Query** for server state (configured with QueryClientProvider)
- **TanStack Store** for local state management
- Demo store and devtools available in `src/lib/demo-store.ts`

### Component Architecture
- Uses Shadcn/ui component system
- Component utilities in `src/lib/utils.ts`
- Header component demonstrates basic structure
- Uses `class-variance-authority` for component variants

## 🎯 Backend Implementation Status

- **Redis** for sessions and caching  
- **Database migrations** included
- **Comprehensive schema** for e-commerce
- **Advanced features**: Purchase patterns, abandonment tracking, recommendation scoring
- **Automated Jobs**: Scheduled tasks for cart recovery and data cleanup

### 🐳 **Docker Development Environment**

**Services Included:**
- **PostgreSQL 15** (Port 5432) - Main database with auto-initialized schema
- **Redis 7** (Port 6379) - Session storage and caching
- **Adminer** (Port 8080) - Database management UI

**Quick Setup:**
```bash
# Start all services with fresh database
docker-compose down -v && docker-compose up -d

# Seed with sample data (categories, products, test users)
npm run seed
```

**Database Features:**
- **Dual Authentication Schema**: Supports both email/password and Google OAuth
- **Email Verification**: Secure token-based email verification system  
- **Password Reset**: Secure password reset with time-limited tokens
